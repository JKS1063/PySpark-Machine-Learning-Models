You’ve been flown out to their HQ in Ulsan, South Korea!
It’s one of the world’s largest manufacturers of large ships, including cruise liners!

They need your help them give accurate estimates of how many crew members a ship will require.

They are currently selling ships to some new customers and want you to create a model and use
it to predict how many crew members the ships will need.

Your job is to create a regression model that will help predict how many crew members will be needed for future ships.
In other words, use the features you think will be useful to predict the value in the Crew column. 

The client also mentioned that they have found that particular cruise lines will differ in acceptable crew counts, so it 
is most likely an important feature to include in your analysis!
