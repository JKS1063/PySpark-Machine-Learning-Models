Youâ€™ve been contacted by a top marketing agency to help them out with customer churn!

You need to help out a marketing agency predict customer churn!

A marketing agency has many customers that use their service to produce ads for the client/customer websites. 
They've noticed that they have quite a bit of churn in clients. 

They currently randomly assign account managers , but want you to create a machine learning model that will help 
predict which customers will churn (stop buying their service) so that they can correctly assign the customers most 
at risk to churn an account manager.

Create a classification algorithm that will help classify whether or not a customer churned. 

Then the company can test this against incoming data for future customers to predict which 
customers will churn and assign them an account manager.
